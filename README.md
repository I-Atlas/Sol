## Commands
Commands are, by default, invoked by typing in `!` followed by a command's name. Typing in `!help` will cause Sol to direct message you a list of commands for you to browse. That list is dynamically updated based on the code and, therefore, will always be up to date.

Server administrators can choose to set a custom prefix to invoke commands. This custom prefix can be any string input, including emojis or mentions.
