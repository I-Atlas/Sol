## Getting Started
Sol is a Discord bot written in Python.

## Prefix
Commands are, by default, invoked by typing in `!` followed by a command's name. Typing in `!help` will cause Sol to direct message you a list of commands for you to browse. That list is dynamically updated based on the code and, therefore, will always be up to date.

Server administrators can choose to set a custom prefix to invoke commands. This custom prefix can be any string input, including emojis or mentions.

## Modules
At the moment, Sol can:
* Moderation
* Fun
* Informative
* Customizable embed color
